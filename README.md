# LazyCppSnips
Quick, probably bad, solutions to problems that I encountered but didn't want to spend time on

No one should ever use any code in this repository. None of it is any good. You've been warned.

## Table of Contents

- *GuidThings.cpp*: Lazy ways to move GUIDs to and from C-style strings (Windows)
- *IsAdmin.cpp*: Determines if the current process (Windows) was started with elevated user rights
- *WindowsLocalIPAddress.cpp*: Demo program that automatically creates and maintains a map of local network interface indexes and local IP addresses on Windows
- *GetValueOrDefault.cpp*: Checks a pointer to a complex class to see if its target exists. If it does not, returns a default value for a specific data member of the target class. If the target does exist, returns the value held by that target class's specific data member.
